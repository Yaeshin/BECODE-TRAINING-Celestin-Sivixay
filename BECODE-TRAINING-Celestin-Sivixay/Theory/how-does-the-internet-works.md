# How does the Internet works ?

Most people know how to use the Internet but most don't understand how it works. I will explain how it works thanks to the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_LPdttKXPc&ab_channel=Aaron) from Aaron Titus.

## What is the Internet ?

Most people think the Internet is like a cloud but it actually is a **wire**.
If 2 computers are connected to this wire then they can communicate.
Servers are special computers connected to the Internet while web pages are *files* on those computers.

All computers connected to the wire that is the Internet are identified by an IP address but since those are hard to remember they also get domain names such as :

- google.com
- facebook.com
- anything.com

Those names make it way easier for people to use websites and the Internet.

## How is it as "regular" users ?

The computers used by most people every day are called clients and are not directly connected to the wire but through an internet provider.
If someone were to send an email to someone else with a different type of email address, the computer of the first person would only communicate with their own email provider and that provider would communicate with the other email provider.

## How is information sent ?

Some information can be really heavy to transfer while others might be very light, how do computer make sure that everything is sent and there is no error with the information sent ?

>That is because they divide those information into smaller pieces sent through numerous packages which are then reassembled in order to remake the complete information.

### How do computers know where to send information ?

Most of the time, be it your sister, brother, colleague or friend, you may not be alone on your internet connection so how do computer make sur to send the information to the right place ?

>It is very simple, it is because everything connected directly or indirectly to the Internet has a unique IP address while at every junction where 2 or more parts of the Internet intersect, there is a router which indicates to each package where they should be sent.
